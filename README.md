🧾 ElectroHub – Sales Data Analytics Dashboard
📌 Business Problem
ElectroHub, an electronic retail company, faced difficulty in understanding its nationwide sales performance and profit distribution across cities, product categories, and promotions.
Key business challenges included:

Identifying top and bottom-performing products by sales, profit, and quantity sold.
Understanding sales trends over time (daily, monthly, quarterly, and annually).
Measuring the impact of discounts and promotional offers on overall profit.
Tracking regional performance to guide better marketing and inventory decisions.

 Dashboard Goal

To design an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides clear, data-driven insights on:
Overall business performance and order volume.
Profitability trends and product performance.
Regional sales distribution and discount analysis.
Comparative analysis between different time periods and categories.
This dashboard enables ElectroHub’s management team to make informed decisions about pricing, promotions, and product stocking.




📊 Key Visuals 
Map (Sales by City)	Displays sales distribution across Indian cities to quickly identify high and low revenue regions.

Card (Number of Orders)	Shows total order count (3510) — a quick snapshot of business volume.

Bar Chart (Average Discount by Promotion Category)	Highlights which promotional types (e.g., Weekend Flash Sale, Clearance Sale) offer the highest average discounts and their possible profit impact.

Scatter Plot (Profit vs Net Sales)	Visualizes the correlation between profit and net sales; a strong positive trend indicates healthy profit margins.
Line Chart (Sales Trend Over Time)	Tracks net sales growth across dates to detect seasonal or monthly sales patterns.

Bar Charts (Top & Bottom 5 Products by Sales, Profit, and Quantity Sold)	Identifies best and worst performing products to optimize inventory and pricing.

Table View (Order-wise Data)	Provides detailed transaction-level view with filters for Date, Product, Customer, and Promotion to support deeper analysis.
Comparison Bars (Between Two Date Ranges)	Allows managers to compare sales, profit, and quantity between any two selected time periods to measure campaign effectiveness.



💼 Business Impact & Insights
Top 5 products (e.g., Apple iPhone 14, MacBook Air, Sony Bravia TV) contributed to over 40% of total revenue, indicating strong brand-driven sales.
Weekend Flash Sales generated the highest discounts but still maintained strong profits, suggesting effective promotional strategy.
Bangalore, Delhi, and Mumbai emerged as top-performing cities in both sales and profit.
The Profit vs Sales correlation showed that higher sales consistently led to higher profits, confirming efficient cost management.
Seasonal patterns showed spikes in Q2 and Q4, likely driven by festival and end-of-season promotions.
Managers can now use the dashboard’s filters and comparison visuals to monitor campaign performance, adjust discount strategies, and improve inventory planning.
