Top 5 products (e.g., Apple iPhone 14, MacBook Air, Sony Bravia TV) contributed to over 40% of total revenue, indicating strong brand-driven sales.
Weekend Flash Sales generated the highest discounts but still maintained strong profits, suggesting effective promotional strategy.
Bangalore, Delhi, and Mumbai emerged as top-performing cities in both sales and profit.
The Profit vs Sales correlation showed that higher sales consistently led to higher profits, confirming efficient cost management.
